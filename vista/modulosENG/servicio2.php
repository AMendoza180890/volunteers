                    <p>You can help share the love of Christ by serving with Tesoros de Dios. Every year, we host trips of all sizes and cultural backgrounds - from individuals to large groups.  Serving with Tesoros de Dios will be a life-changing experience for you and your team. At our core, we believe in partnering with local churches, schools, and communities, which is how ministry takes place day after day.</p>

                    <p>You and your team will help meet the physical and spiritual needs of people with disabilities in Nicaragua. Each mission trip is unique and can be tailored to match the skills of your group, the individual person, and the needs of the community you are serving. When you serve with Tesoros de Dios on a mission trip, you are sharing the hope of Jesus and joining the vision to bring life transformation to every man, woman, and child with disabilities.</p>

                    <p>Reach out to our volunteer coordinator to begin planning!</p>
